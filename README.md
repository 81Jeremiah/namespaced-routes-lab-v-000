# Namespaced Routes Lab

## Objectives

1. Organize controllers with a module
2. Use namespaced routes

## Overview

We're going to add some administrator functions to our song library and
use what we learned about namespaced routes and module scope to organize
our routes and controllers.

## Instructions

The base application has been provided with tests. Make sure to run
`rake db:seed` to set up seed data. Tests can be run with `rspec`.

1. Create a model called `Preference` with two `string` fields:
   `song_sort_order` and `artist_sort_order` and two `boolean` fields:
`allow_create_artists` and `allow_create_songs`.
2. Implement a `SettingsController` under an `Admin` module with `index` and `update` actions. It will be responsible for maintaining two
`preference` entries named `song_sort_order` and `artist_sort_order`. There
should only be one record for each so try `first_or_create` to
create an `@preference` in the controller. The default `value` for each sort preference should be "DESC". Redirect to `settings#index` after update.
  * **Hint:** Because Rails doesn't know how to "count" `Settings`, the
    helper for the index route will be different than you're used to.
Instead of `admin_settings_path` going to `/admin/settings`, you'll need
to use `admin_settings_index_path`. Make sure to run `rake routes` to
verify your URL helper names.
3. Implement routes and views for the `SettingsController`. Use
   radio buttons for the values. Acceptable values are "ASC" and "DESC".
Both preferences should be editable from the `index` view whether new or existing.
4. Update the `artists#index` action to order by `name` with `artist_sort_order`
   and the `songs#index` action to order songs by `title` with `song_sort_order`. Make sure to check that the value exists and set it to the default if it doesn't.
5. Implement an `AccessController` under the `Admin` module with
   `index` and `update` actions. It will be responsible for maintaining
two preference entries named `allow_create_artists` and
`allow_create_songs`. As with the `SettingsController`, use
`first_or_create` to ensure we only have one `preference`. The default values for `allow_create_songs` and `allow_create_artists` should be `true`. Redirect to `access#index` after update.
6. Implement routes and views to manipulate for the `AccessController`. Use radio buttons for the values. Acceptable values are
"true" and "false". Follow the same guidelines as for
`SettingsController` views in step 3.
  * **Note:** We will have the same URL helper change here as we do for
    `SettingsController`, so check your `rake routes` to ensure you use
the right helpers.
7. Update the `songs#new` and `artists#new` actions to check the access
   control preferences and redirect to `/songs` and `/artists`,
respectively, if creation is disabled.
8. Make sure tests pass.
9. Ride the bull. Feel the flow.
